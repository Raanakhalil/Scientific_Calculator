I just built and deployed a Scientific Calculator Web App using Streamlit , and it’s now live on Hugging Face Spaces!

With this calculator, you can easily evaluate a wide range of mathematical expressions, including:

- Trigonometric functions: sin(θ), cos(θ), tan(θ)
- Roots & logs: sqrt(x), log10(x)
- Power & exponential: power(x, y), exp(x)
- Factorials: factorial(n)
- Rounding & conversions: abs(x), round(x), ceil(x), floor(x), degrees(x), radians(x)…and much more!

- Streamlit sdk :1.44.1
